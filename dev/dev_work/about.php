						StoryBlox is a semester long project designed by the students of CPSC 348 at Chapman University during Spring 2014. As the main assignment for the class, students were tasked with the problem of creating a functional website to help people with Autism Spectrum Disorder create social stories that they could share with other people. The purpose of this class and project were to learn how the software engineering industry operates and to apply those techniques to a non-trivial problem. We hope you enjoy what we've created!
